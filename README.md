Glue
====

It's not stable development version. Work on this module is just started.
Glue module adds to Awesome WM ability to group several windows (to glue) and show only one of them. User can switch between glued windows. 
It maybe helpful when you want to glue together all similar windows (skype chats for instance) and operate with them like with single window.
